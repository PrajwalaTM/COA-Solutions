\Exercise
What are the advantages of the segmented addressing mode? Why do modern x86 processors
need the LDT and GDT tables?
 \Answer  :
\begin{enumerate}
\item Protection:Each program can be allocated a certain section of memory .Other programs cannot use this memory, so each program is protected from interference from other programs.
\item Extended memory: Increases the memory a single program can access.
\item Virtualmemory: Expands the address space.
\item Multitasking:Enables the microprocessor to switch from one program to another so the computer can execute several programs at once
\end{enumerate}

The code, data and stack have their own segments in a x86 processor, thus for program execution we need to access the segments related to a process.
The LDT being local to a process, is used to access segments that a process uses as each entry is indexed by segment id, contains starting address of segment, and privileges required to access it.
The GDT  is  a system wide table that is shared by all processes running on machine. For this purpose, it contains pointers to each LDT.\\

\Exercise
Explain the memory addressing modes in x86.
\Answer :
\begin{enumerate}
\item register-indirect: V $\leftarrow$ [r1] . The register saves the address of the memory location that contains the value.
\item base-offset : V $\leftarrow$ [r1+offset] . The base memory address is fetched from r1, constant offset is added and the new memory is accessed by the processor.
\item base-index :V $\leftarrow$ [r1+r2] . The memory address is equal to the sum of register 1 and register 2.
\item base-index-offset :V $\leftarrow$ [r1+r2+offset] . The memory address contains the value as the sum of r1,r2 and offset.
\item base-scaled-index-offset :V $\leftarrow$ [r1+(index*scale) +offset]. The base is in register r1.The index is stored in other register which is multiplied by a power of 2. After this, the offset is added.  
\item memory- direct : V $\leftarrow$ [memory in hexadecimal].
\end{enumerate}

\Exercise
Describe the floating point registers and the floating point stack in x86.
\Answer :
FP registers : A total of 16 registers
\begin{enumerate}
\item 8 general purpose st0 to st7
\item  FPCR Floating-point control register
\item  FPSR Floating-point status register
\item  FPTAG Tag word
\item  FPIOFF Instruction offset
\item  FPISEL Instruction selector
\item  FPDOFF Data offset
\item  FPDSEL Data selector
\end{enumerate}

FP STACK-The FPU has 8 registers---st0 to st7, formed into a stack called FP stack.FPU instructions push numbers onto the stack from memory, are acted upon by fp instructions and then popped off the stack back to memory.\\

\Exercise[difficulty=1]
We can specify an entire 32 bit immediate in a single instruction in x86. Recall that this was not possible in ARM
and \simplerisc. What are the advantages and disadvantages of having this feature in the ISA?
\Answer:
Advantages : 
\begin{enumerate}
\item No memory reference other than instruction fetch is required to obtain the operand, thus saving one memory or cache cycle in the instruction cycle.
\item Specifying an immediate reduces the number of lines of code in a given algorithm.
\end{enumerate}
Disadvantage :
\begin{enumerate}
\item Inflexible: The value retrieved is hard coded and non-changeable, since modification of code once it is running is improper and in many systems impossible.
\end{enumerate} 

\Exercise [difficulty=1]
We claim that using a stack based architecture makes the software very portable. It does not need to be aware of 
the number and semantics of registers in an ISA. Comment on this statement, and try to find other reasons
for preferring a stack based machine.
\Answer:A stack based architecture can get by with just two visible registers, the top of the stack and the next instruction address. It simply works by popping data, performing instructions on it and pushing it back to the stack. The other registers have no immediate need. So, it does not need to be aware of the number and semantics of registers in ISA.

Reasons for preferring a stack based machine is:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Very compact object code: Stack machines have much smaller instructions than the other styles of machines.  
\item Able to use Out-of-Order Execution: Out-of-order execution in stack machines seems to reduce or avoid many theoretical and practical difficulties.
\item Simple compilers: Compilers for stack machines are simpler and quicker to build than compilers for other machines
\item Fast operand access: Since there are no operand fields to decode, stack machines fetch each instruction and its operands at same time. So compared to register machines, stack machines can omit operand fetching stage.
\item Minimal processor state: A machine with an expression stack can get by with just two visible registers, the top-of-stack address and the next-instruction address.
\end{enumerate}

\Exercise[difficulty=2]
Given an arithmetic expression containing floating point operands, how can we evaluate it using a floating point
stack? What should be the order of loading and operating on operands? 
[HINT: A regular arithmetic operation such as -- (1 + 2.5) * 3.9 -- is called an infix expression. To evaluate
expressions using a stack, we need to convert it into a postfix expression of the form -- 1 2.5 + 3.9 *. Here,
we first push 1 and 2.5 on the stack, add the result, push 3.9 on the stack, and multiply the first two entries.
The reader should read more about postfix expressions in textbooks on discrete mathematics.]
\Answer :
We use stack to first convert infix to postfix notation by the stack and then calculate value of postfix expression using a stack.
Transforming Infix to Postfix :
Let Q be the arithmetic expression in infix notation and  P be the equivalent postfix expression.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Push left paranthesis onto Stack and add right parenthesis to the end of Q.
\item Scan Q from left to right and repeat steps 3 to 6 for each element of Q until STACK is empty
\item If an operand is encountered add it to P
\item If a left parenthesis is encountered, push onto STACK
\item If an operator op is encountered , then:
     Repeatedly pop from STACK and add to P each operator on the top of STACK which has the same precedence as or higher precedence than op\\
     Add op to STACK\\
---End of If structure
\item If a right parenthesis is encountered, then:
Repeatedly pop from STACK and add to P each operator until a left parenthesis is encountered.\\
Remove the left parenthesis.\\
---End of If structure
---End of Step 2 loop
\item Exit
\end{enumerate}
Evaluation of postfix :
\begin {enumerate}
\item Add a right parenthesis at the end of P
\item Scan P from left to right and repeat steps 3 and 4 for each element of P until parenthesis is encountered.
\item If an operand is encountered , put it on STACK .
\item If an operator op is encountered
               Remove the top two elements of STACK, A being the top element and B being the other one.\\
               Evaluate B op A.\\
               Place the result of this evaluation back on STACK.\\
---End of If structure
---End of Step 2 loop
\item Pop the top element of STACK to get the final value of the mathematical expression.
\item Exit\\
\end{enumerate}

\Exercise
Why is the $mov$ instruction a very versatile instruction?
\Answer
The mov instruction in x86 is able to move the contents of a register, immediate or even memory location into another memory location or register(Exception:Source and Destination can't both be memory locations).This way the mov instruction can achieve the function of loading and storing memory values because it accepts memory operands, preventing us from dedicating any seperate load/store instruction in x86 and allowing us to fuse the functionality of three RISC instructions into a single CISC instruction.

What is the value of the $ModR/M$ byte when we need to specify a memory address that does not have any base
or index registers? Assume that the value of the $reg$ field is 000. 
\Answer:
ModR/M: 0x03

\Exercise[difficulty=1] Assume that we have an instruction that has a single operand of the form $[ebp]$. How do we encode it
using the fields in the ModR/M byte?
\Answer:
ModR/X :0x48

\Exercise[difficulty=1] What are the values of the SIB and ModR/M bytes for the instruction, {\em mov eax, [ebx*4]}?
\Answer:
ModR/M:0x04\\
SIB   :0x9D
